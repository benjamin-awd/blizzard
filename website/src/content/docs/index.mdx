## Two-Stage Pipeline

Blizzard uses a two-tool architecture for reliable Delta Lake ingestion:

- **Blizzard** ingests NDJSON files and writes Parquet files to a staging area
- **Penguin** watches the staging area and commits files to Delta Lake

This separation provides fault tolerance—if one component fails, the other continues operating, and recovery is automatic on restart.
