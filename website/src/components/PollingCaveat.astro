<Aside type="caution" title="Polling Performance">
  Both Blizzard and Penguin use polling to discover new files. For optimal performance, files should have **lexicographically ordered names** (e.g., timestamps or UUIDv7). This enables high watermark tracking, where only files newer than the last processed file are listed. Without lexicographical ordering, the entire directory (or partition) must be listed on every poll interval.
